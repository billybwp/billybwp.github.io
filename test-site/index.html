    <h2>If you doubt the weight, don't lift it.</h2>
    <p>
      Don't lift too much weight on the gym. It will lead into an injury, i just
      learned my lesson yesterday when i broke my right forearm bone, it may be
      just a minor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture">fracture</a>, but the accident make me cannot go to the gym for
      at least 3 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you happen to have accident like me at the gym, it will make your
      life harder: <ul><li>You cannot eat easily.</li> <li>Filling glass of water will be hard</li> <li>Taking a shower and washing your back will become so fucking hard.</li></ul> </p> 
     <p> what's more annoying is that you have to endure
      this pain for about 1 week before you can easily do your daily task again!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the point is, gym accident sucks even though the accident is minor, it
      is still very sucks. Do not lift too much weight. Only lift when you are
      confident with the weight.
